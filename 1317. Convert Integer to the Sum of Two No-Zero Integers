No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

    a and b are No-Zero integers.
    a + b = n

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.


code:


class Solution:
    def getNoZeroIntegers(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(n):
            b=n-i
            if '0' not in str(i)  and '0' not in str(b):
                return [i,b]
