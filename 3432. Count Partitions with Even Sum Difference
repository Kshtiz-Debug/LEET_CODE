You are given an integer array nums of length n.

A partition is defined as an index i where 0 <= i < n - 1, splitting the array into two non-empty subarrays such that:

    Left subarray contains indices [0, i].
    Right subarray contains indices [i + 1, n - 1].

Return the number of partitions where the difference between the sum of the left and right subarrays is even.



code:


class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count=0
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            suma=0
            sumb=0
            a=nums[:i]
            b=nums[i:]
            for j in a:
                suma+=j
            for j in b:
                sumb+=j
            if (suma-sumb)%2==0:
                count+=1
        return count




Approach:
So the question was to check for the number of subarrays that will result in a even difference of sum .
