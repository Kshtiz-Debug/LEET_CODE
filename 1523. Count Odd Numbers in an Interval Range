Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).




code:



class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        count=0
        if low%2==0 and high%2==0:
            count=(high-low)//2
        elif (low%2==0 and high%2!=0) or (low%2!=0 and high%2==0):
            count=((high+1)-low)//2
        elif low%2!=0 and high%2!=0:
            count=((high-low)//2)+1
        return count
