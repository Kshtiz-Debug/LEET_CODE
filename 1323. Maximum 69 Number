You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).


code:


class Solution:
    def maximum69Number (self, num: int) -> int:
        s=""
        x=0
        y=0
        for i in str(num):
            y=y+1
            if i=="6" and x==0:
                x=y
                s=s+"9"
            if x!=y:
                s=s+i
        return int(s)
