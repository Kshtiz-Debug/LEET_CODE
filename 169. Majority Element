Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.



code:

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        d={}
        for i in nums:
            if i in d:
                d[i]+=1
            else:
                d[i]=1
        m=0
        maj=0
        for keys in d:
            if m<d[keys]:
                m=d[keys]
                maj=keys

        return maj

approach:

So the whole point is to get ur mind to think in different possible ways so that it can deal with new problems .
and the concept is pretty simple . 
I dont think that I need to explain this
If you are not able to understand the code then study the basics of dictionaries


The moment I saw abt frequency of numbers .... Dictionaries were the first thing that came to my mind ..... and i solved
