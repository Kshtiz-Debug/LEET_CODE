You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

    Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.


output:

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        o=0
        sum=0
        for i in nums:
            sum+=i
        while True:
            if sum%k==0:
                return o
            else:
                sum-=1
                o+=1




Approach:

So isntead of going and choosing a partiular index ,i just started subtracting from the sum and kept incrementing a tracker variable to keep a track of the amt that we are subtracting from our sum.
