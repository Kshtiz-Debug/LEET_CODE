You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



code :


class Solution:

    def r(self ,step , memo):
        if step in memo:
            return memo[step]
        memo[step]= self.r(step-1,memo)+self.r(step-2,memo)
        return memo[step]
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo={1:1,0:1}
        z=self.r(n,memo)
        return z






Now here as you can see we are solving it using recurrsion. Its almost similar to fibonacci series .
The memo dictionary is used to prevent some excess calculation and make it more efficient .
