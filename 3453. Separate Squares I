You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.

Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area of the squares above the line equals the total area of the squares below the line.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted multiple times.

        for i in squares:
            area=area+(i[2]**2)
            low=min(low,i[1])
            high=max(high,i[1]+i[2])

            else:
                high=mid
