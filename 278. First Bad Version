You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.




code:


# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left,right=0,n
        while left<right:
            mid=int(left+right)//2
            if isBadVersion(mid)==False:
                left=mid+1
            else:
                right=mid
        return right

So for this problem ... if you go any other way then in most cases it will exceed the time limit
SO TO prevent that from happening we are using binary search in this problem

As it is faster is problems like these and is useful when you have to work in less time
