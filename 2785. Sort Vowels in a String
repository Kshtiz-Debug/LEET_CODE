Given a 0-indexed string s, permute s to get a new string t such that:

    All consonants remain in their original places. More formally, if there is an index i with 0 <= i < s.length such that s[i] is a consonant, then t[i] = s[i].
    The vowels must be sorted in the nondecreasing order of their ASCII values. More formally, for pairs of indices i, j with 0 <= i < j < s.length such that s[i] and s[j] are vowels, then t[i] must not have a higher ASCII value than t[j].

Return the resulting string.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in lowercase or uppercase. Consonants comprise all letters that are not vowels.





code:



class Solution:
    def sortVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        def conso(s):
            return s
        final=""
        store=[]
        vowels=['A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u']
        for i in s:
            if i in vowels:
                store.append(i)
        store=sorted(store)
        x=0
        for i in s:
            if i not in vowels:
                final+=i
            else:
                final+=store[x]
                x+=1
        return final

concept:

So we had been given with a string that might or might not have vowels in it . And what was instructed was to keep the consonants at the same place while making the vowels arrange 
in non-decreasing or ascending order.
Now the first that came to my mind was to ................. uhmmmmm ........... No it wasn't abt coding 
It was maths 
Permutation and Combination concept where we arrange some people based on some given conditions .
Well this question is giving me that type of vibe ..........
Sorry .. Let's get back to the question


So I brought back my mind from P&C to coding .....

I had this idea that I will need to define a list for the vowels.
And then for the consonants I need to keep them at the same place .
So i made a seperate function which to be honest was'nt required but ......uhmmm .... functions are cool ... so yeah I like cool stuffs in my code
Then I made a list of all the vowels present in the string and sorted them ...... Why???......... Well after giving it a thought I came up with this arrangement ....

Then it is all basics ............. and we all know that much ........... ig <wink>
