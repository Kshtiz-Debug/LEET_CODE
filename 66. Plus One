You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

code:

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        s=""
        for i in digits:
            s=s+str(i)
        n=int(s)+1
        z=[]
        for i in str(n):
            z.append(int(i))
        return z
